# dka-2-mka-tests
A testing script and a set of tests for dka-2-mka project

Extract into the same folder as Makefile and necessary source files. The script compares actual 
and reference outputs on the basis of plain file comparison, so it is suggested you adjust the
reference output files to match your state naming convensions.

Another set of useful tests can be found at https://github.com/vokracko/FLP-DKA-2-MKA-test
